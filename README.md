**1. V1 - Base**

Should be simple and useful.

- User should use a .csv to input the keywords and questions to show on the Input Panel;

  - User should edit the csv directly. The table is only for reading.
- Only one pdf can be edited;
- Fixed font? ;
- User can select where the pdf generated will be saved;
- Helper tab to give a basic explanation.
